## What is Game Development 1?

Game Development 1 (GD1) is a year long course developed for Mastery Coding's High School Unity Certification pathway. The course includes video-based tutorials teaching fundamental concepts in game development, computer science, and coding, while guiding students through the creation of 5 Unity projects all built from scratch.

## GD1 Projects

In GD1, students learn about game development by developing games. The course teaches students to build five different projects, each demonstrating core development concepts for different genres as well as covering fundamental computer science topics including but not limited to: Control Structures, Collections, Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, Design Patterns, Event-Driven Architecture.
